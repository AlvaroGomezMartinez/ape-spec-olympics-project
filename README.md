* SPECIAL OLYMPICS STUDENT DATABASE Project
** Northside ISD
** Academic Technology Department

**Background:** This project is meant to facilitate the organization of student data that is collected in a GoogleSheet. The data is then used to generate reports that are shared with the Special Olympics coaches and volunteers. The data is collected by the Special Education Adapted Physical Education (APE) teachers and is used to organize the students into events for the Special Olympics. The data is collected in a GoogleSheet labeled 'Special Olympics Student Database' and is then used to generate reports that are shared with the Special Olympics coaches and volunteers. The reports are generated by running the functions in the Apps Script Project labeled 'Special Olympics Student Database'. The reports are then shared with the Special Olympics coaches and volunteers.

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Create a Google Drive folder to organize the database and reports. Currently, a Google Drive Folder called APE Special Olympics Project was created to organize the needed template files (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1amRAgl9agb3I2zrDXuISJFOSuvw6iGFa?usp=drive_link).
2. Create a nested folder inside the one created in step 1. Currently the APE Special Olympics Project folder has a subfolder called Reports (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bXDXyWz8lwcFygs1TbXONoGmfS9Z1yW9?usp=drive_link).
3. Create eight GoogleDocs inside the nested folder from step 2. Currently, inside Reports are eight GoogleDocs that serve as templates for the reports that are generated when their associated functions are run:
 * (1) Field Condensed List - Females
 * (2) Field Condensed List - Males
 * (3) Field Heat Sheets - Females
 * (4) Field Heat Sheets - Males
 * (5) Track Condensed List - Females
 * (6) Track Condensed List - Males
 * (7) Track Heat Sheets - Females
 * (8) Track Heat Sheets - Males
4. After the eight GoogleDoc templates are created, get the document IDs from each one and copy them over to their corresponding variable in the Global Variables file in this project.
5. Set a trigger to run the function onOpen(), found inside the Menus.gs file of this project, when the spreadsheet is opened.
6. Set a trigger to run the function insertFormula(), found inside the Age.gs file of this project, when the spreadsheet is edited.

**Project's Progress - Updates:**
On 4/1/24, continued updating the project files.

**Pending tasks:**

* See if it's possible to add a page break by campus
* T&F Alphabetical - list by campus- have the report cut off by campus
* For the labels:
    * Day 1 Alphabetical by Campus
    * Day 2 "             "   "
    * ...
